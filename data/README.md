# **Datasets for Training ML Models**

## **Purpose**
- This folder is dedicated to storing datasets that are used for training, validating, and testing machine learning (ML) models.
- The datasets contained within this folder serve as the foundational data required for developing and evaluating various ML algorithms and models.

## **Structure**
- **/datasets**  
  - This directory contains all datasets in various formats such as CSV, JSON, Excel, etc.
  - **/raw_data**  
    - Stores the original, unprocessed datasets.
  - **/processed_data**  
    - Contains datasets that have been cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed for use in ML models.

## **Usage**
- **Adding Datasets:**
  - Place new raw datasets in the `/datasets/raw_data` folder.
  - If you preprocess the data, save the processed version in the `/datasets/processed_data` folder.
- **Accessing Datasets:**
  - Use the datasets in this folder to train, validate, and test ML models.
  - Ensure that the correct version of the dataset (raw or processed) is used depending on the requirements of the task.

## **Contributing**
- Please document any new datasets added to this folder.
- If you preprocess a dataset, note the steps taken and the changes made.
- Ensure that large datasets are stored in an efficient format to save space and optimize load times.

## **License**
- This folder and the datasets contained within are provided for educational and research purposes.
- Please verify and respect any licenses associated with the datasets before use.
